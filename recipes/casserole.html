        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This is an easy and very tasty dish. I often substitute ground turkey and low fat dairy products and it is still delicious! Serve with chips, salsa and green salad. </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>2 cups salsa </li>
            <li>1 -16 ounce- can chili beans, drained</li>
