        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This is a quick and easy main dish. My kids don't even like cabbage, but they love this. I usually try to serve it with green beans, new potatoes, corn, and a pan of corn bread. They eat over half the pan every time. Also, the longer it stands the better it tastes.  </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef  </li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped  </li>
            <li>1 small head cabbage, chopped  </li>
            <li>2 14.5 ounce cans diced tomatoes </li>
            <li>1 8 ounce can tomato sauce  </li>
            <li>Â½ cup water </li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced  </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt  </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a Dutch oven or large skillet over medium-high heat. </li>
            <li>Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot Dutch oven until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. </li>
            <li>Add cabbage, tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, garlic, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. </li>
            <li>Cover Dutch oven, reduce heat, and simmer until cabbage is tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
